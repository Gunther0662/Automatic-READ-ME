# Automatic READ ME

## Description

The webpage was design to make the READ ME file in a repository for GitHub automatic by using and answering question in the terminal. When creatingn a READ ME file it can be a little tedious while at the same time having a limited time to turn in your project. By creating this automatic READ ME generator i intend to provide the correct structure of a well developed file and maintain it through my projects. As well as, it can be abalable for other people thta would benefit in creating a rightfull READ ME page by ansering question in the terminal. What I learn from creating this webpage would be the concept of usding node and npm index.js to create files and generate a html or READ ME file by using the terminal.
